# Chat-Bot-Guessing-Game


For this project I built a guessing game,
The base premise of the game is as follows 
  
  1. The bot provides the user with clues with respect to what word the user needs to guess
  (in total there 5 clues) these should be stored in the "values" of the dictionary
  
  2. The user inputs theirs guess using the keyboard 
    * If the user player guesses correctly, then the bot moves on to the next word 
    * If the players guesses incorrectly, then the bot reveals the word and moves on to the next word 
    * Each time their is a guess the Users score and bots score is incremented 
    * Eventually declaring a winner win theirs is no more guesses
